This folder hosts the build file (build.xml) and some of the shell scripts
to run the various tools produced by executing the corresponding targets
in the build.

You only need the binaries (.jars) and scripts (.sh, .py) along with the
libraries (in ../lib) to run most of the sourcerer tools. Thus a suggested
layout for these files can be as follows

<sourcerer tools folder>
|-- core-repomanager
|   |-- content-fetcher.sh
|   |-- core-repomanager.jar
|   `-- repo-folder-creator.sh
|-- indexing
|   |-- merge-cluster-index.sh
|   |-- run-index-merger.sh
|   `-- sourcerer-search.jar
|-- similarity
|   |-- run-filtered-usage-writer.sh
|   |-- run-raw-usage-writer.sh
|   |-- run-similarity-writer.sh
|   |-- sourcerer-db.jar
|    `-- sourcerer-ml.jar
`-- lib
    |-- < all required external dependencies >
    |-- apache-solr-clustering-1.4.0.jar
    |-- apache-solr-common-1.3.0.jar
    |-- apache-solr-core-1.3.0.jar
    `-- etc..
